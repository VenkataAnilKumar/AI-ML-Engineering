## FAQ

Q: Are all resources free?  
A: Yes. Some courses offer paid certificates, but learning content is free when listed.

Q: Can I add my own blog?  
A: If it’s substantive, vendor-neutral, and freely accessible, yes—follow the format in CONTRIBUTING.

Q: Why do some links point to docs instead of tutorials?  
A: Official docs often host excellent tutorials and guides that remain up-to-date.
